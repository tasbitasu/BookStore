# BookStore
Laravel Simple Project
I am Tasbiha Zaman student of PUB 23rd batch BSc in CSE, ID-35. 
Today I’m showing my project titled “Laravel Bookstore Management System.”
This is a web-based application developed using Laravel 12. The main purpose of this system is to manage books in a simple and organized way.
🔹 How It Works:
On the home page, it shows a list of all books in a table format.
Each book displays important information like:
Title
Author
ISBN number
Stock quantity
Price
I used CRUD operations, which means:
Create – I can add new books using a form.
Read – I can view the list and details of each book.
Update – I can edit and update book information.
Delete – I can delete any book from the list.
For each book, there are buttons: View, Edit, and Delete to perform these actions.
I also added pagination, which means only 10 books are shown per page — making it easier to browse large lists.
🔹 Technical Details:
I used Laravel Controllers to handle the logic,
Models to interact with the database,
And Blade templates for the front-end design.
The database is created with migrations, and I used MySQL to store the data.
For styling, I used Bootstrap 5 to make it look clean and responsive.
In short, this project helped me learn how to use Laravel's MVC structure to build a complete book management system.
Thank You!
